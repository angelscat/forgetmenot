Forgetmenot
===========

Clocking in at version 1.0 'cause it feels so good.

One-Sentence Pitch
------------------
Forgetmenot is *the* self-hosted ToDo List application, just as (I would argue) WordPress is *the* self-hosted blogging application.  

Goal
----
Forgetmenot is a self-hosted ToDo List application that is accessible via web and mobile browser.
Its datastore makes use of a SQLite database.

*  Accessible via modern mobile browsers
*  Uses SQLite DB
*  Pretty to look at, pretty to use
	* *TODO* Skin-able
*  Basic HTTP Auth to password protect your todos
*  *TODO*  Folder/Sub-list Support
*  *TODO*  Meta-Information Available for each ToDo
	*  Notes
	*  URL
	*  Due Date
*  *TODO*  Multi-user accounts
