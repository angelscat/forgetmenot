Forgetmenot
===========

**Forgetmenot is under development at the moment...**

One-Sentence Pitch
------------------
Forgetmenot is *the* self-hosted ToDo List application, just as (I would argue) WordPress is *the* self-hosted blogging application.  

Goal
----
Forgetmenot is a self-hosted ToDo List application that is accessible via web and mobile browser.  Its datastore can make use of localStorage or a self-hosted SQLite database.

Features
--------
*  Self-hosted (who wants to rely on a 3rd-party vendor?)
*  Accessible via modern web browser
*  Accessible via modern mobile browsers
*  Uses HTML5's localStorage API or a local SQLite DB
*  Pretty to look at, pretty to use
	* [Eventually] Skin-able
*  Folder/Sub-list Support
*  Meta-Information Available for each ToDo
	*  Notes
	*  URL
	*  Due Date
*  Multi-user accounts


Dependencies
------------
*  Backbone.js
*  Underscore.js
*  jQuery
*  jQuery Mobile
